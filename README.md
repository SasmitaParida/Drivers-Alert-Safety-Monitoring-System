•	This project is a computer vision-based application designed to enhance road safety by detecting signs of driver drowsiness, fatigue, and distraction in real-time. 
•	The system utilizes facial landmarks to monitor eye aspect ratios and lip distances, triggering alerts when specific thresholds indicating drowsiness or yawning are met.
